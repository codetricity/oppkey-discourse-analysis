# Feedback From Person D and Oppkey Plans

April 3, 2025

role: software development

* New to AI, was interested in flowchart showing forum posts first being converted into chunked vectors and using pgvector for similarity search, then using LLM to generate answers based on those chunks.
* Interested in geo data. Looked for his own username. Could not find it. Oppkey realized that the username was not indexed in the vector database. This was a bug that needed to be fixed. Oppkey fixed it before the call.

## Other Notes

* Sent extensive notes and questions on steamlit app ahead of time.
  * Asked to see the list of Unique Organizations
  * Asked about "Average Posts Read" and why countries like Hungary, Oman, and Sweden had such high numbers.
  * Asked about docs that were not in the forum, like the GNSS documentation. Oppkey responded that .guide was providing support for sales and marketing, and we built standalone documents for RICOH US sales to help with market outreach. The forumating looks significally better than forum posts. The RICOH IMU Sensors and GNSS document was built for an ESRI conference.


## Oppkey Future Plans

* Oppkey believes that we should have coordinated with RICOH engineering more directly more often. Aligning the structure of the forum posts with the engineering documentation would have made it easier for users to find the information they needed.
