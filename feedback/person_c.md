# Feedback From Person C and Oppkey Plans

March 31, 2025

role: tech lead

* Created account, used Midori AI, asked in Japanese about internal lens parameter information, did not get a satisfactory answer, not technical
* Was interested in geo data for users
* Wants to implement AI with RICOH partner documentation to make it easier for find information

## Other Notes

* Wants to make parter docs public

## Oppkey Future Plans

* It was a mistake to show Midori persona, since Person C was most likely to be interested in technical documentation. We sent follow up email with instructions for using Theta Persona which has technical documentation uploaded as source. No feedback.
